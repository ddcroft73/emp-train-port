# Portfolio Project (Employee Training Software).

## Purpose:
___
To lessen time spent employee training. Will allow a new employee to learn the job faster and will alleviate the need for two men on one job the entire time training. To totally do away with current employee training when an employee is familiar with the plant. The most difficult aspect of switching for route to route is learning the route. This application will give current employees an edge because they will have access to all parts locations at all times.

## Idea:

Employees will no longer need to be shadowed for a period of days. Using this application, an employee will know:
  1. All part locations without having to spend unneccasary time through trial and error.
  2. (*)What parts need the most attention. 
  3. Full description of the part.
  4. Image indentifier for the part.
  5. Map to show the part location from the home route.
  6. Generated checklist the employee can use to ensure the parts they need and make less trips for forgotten parts.

Supervisors will get vital information from the use:
 - Employee\supervisor paging system: (*)Currently one way communication.
    1. Employees may be reached by the supervisor without knowing personal information. Phone number.
    2. Supervisors may  be reached by the employee without knowing personal information. Phone number.

The employess route and parts checked out for the day can be tallied and reported by the end of the shift.   
Ultimately the consumption of a routes parts may be tracked for long periods of time in this manner.

Basic applicatioin usage:
  1. Employee will register ther information with the application.
  2. Employee wil log in, and may stay loggedin.
  3. The 'HomePage' presented will be a simple option list that they will select the current route.
  4. A simple list, ordered by High to Low will then be generated fron the database.
    - The list will be comprised of:
        - Part ID - Part Location - Part info - Part add to list
        - Part Info will give extra data about the part, Picture and simple map to exactly where it is located.
        - An employee can begin to generate a personal checklist from here by "Adding" the part to a list with a click\tap.
  5. Once the employee has gathered the needed items for the current run, A list will be generated to be checked off
     as each part is aquired. 
  6. At any time a report may be generated, and said report can be emailed to the supervisor.

___ 
* Parts classification:
  All parts will be rated on a 3 tier system, ordered and color coded by rate of consumption.
    - Red - High runners.
    - Orange - Medium runners.
    - Blue - Low runners.
    The parts may be sorted by the way they are located on the line, or by rate of use.

* Paging System:
    - The supervisor and employess will be able to send text messages directly to each other without the need to
      share phone numbers. This feature is in Beta and currrenly only allows th communucation to be sent one way.    
    - There is no need for the pagee to be logged into the system to receive a text. The application uses the persons
      personal phone number they submit at registration but the numbers are only known by the application. The pager
      must be logged in to issue a "Page".  



Thoughts:

Some of these features will become cumbersome to seasoned employees, in fact, they all will. Once an employee knows their route there will be little need to use this application. However the benefits mostly lie with the introduction of new employees so they can do their job more effeciently sooner. 

Proposed features:
 - a QR scanner to allow an employees to simply scan a part and generate a checklist. No need to hand select a part.
 - A 2 way texting feature that will work SMS both ways. As it is it will stil keep an employess\supervisors info private.

 This application is in no way meant to be used on OP premises, for work pertaining to Plastic Omnium. It is only being used as a model for a personal portofolio project, and no OP Property (Part numbers or route names) will be used in the production of said software. I am using my experience as a material handler to solve a problem I have encountered in my day to day life, in the hopes of demonstrating my skills as a software developer to future prospected employers.
