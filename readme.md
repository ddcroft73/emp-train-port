# Portfolio Project (Employee Training Software).

## Purpose:

To lessen time spent employee training. Will allow a new employee to learn the job faster and will consolidate the need for two men on one job the entire time training. Help do away with current employee training when an employee is familiar with the plant. The most difficult aspect of switching from route to route is learning the route. This application will give current employees an edge because they will have access to all part locations at all times.

## Idea:

Employees will no longer need to be shadowed for a period of days. Using this application, an employee will:
  1. Know all part locations without having to spend unneccasary time through trial and error.
  2. (*)Know what parts need the most attention. 
  3. Have a full description of the part.
  4. Have an image indentifier for the part.
  5. Have access to a map to show the part location from the home route.
  6. Have the option of a generated checklist the employee can use to ensure the parts they need and make less trips for forgotten parts.

Supervisors will get vital information from the application user:
 - Employee\supervisor paging system: (*)Currently only one way communication.
    1. Employees may be reached by the supervisor without knowing their personal information. Phone number.
    2. Supervisors may  be reached by the employee without knowing their personal information. Phone number.

The employess route and parts maintained for the day can be tallied and reported by the end of the shift.   
Ultimately the consumption of a routes parts may be tracked for long periods of time in this manner and will make available useful infromation to the supervisor.

## Basic application usage:
  1. Employee will register their information with the application.
  2. Employee wil log in, and may stay logged in.
  3. The 'HomePage' presented will be a simple option list from which they will select their designated route.
  4. A simple list, ordered by High to Low will then be generated from the parts database.
    - The list will be comprised of:
        - Part ID - Part Location - Part info - Part add to list
        - Part info will give extra data about the part, picture and simple map to exact location.
        - An employee may generate a personal checklist from here by "Adding" the part to a list with a click\tap.
  5. Once the employee has gathered the needed items for the current run, A list will be generated to be checked off
     as each part is aquired. 
  6. At any time a report may be generated, and said report can be emailed to the supervisor.

* ## Parts classification:

  All parts will be rated on a 3 tier system, ordered and color coded by rate of consumption.
    - Red - High runners.
    - Orange - Medium runners.
    - Blue - Low runners.
    The parts may be sorted by the way they are located on the line, or by rate of use.

* ## Paging System:
    - The supervisor and employess will be able to send text messages directly to each other without the need to
      share phone numbers. This feature is in Beta and currrenly only allows th communucation to be sent one way.    
    - There is no need for the pagee to be logged into the system to receive a text. The application uses the persons
      personal phone number they submit at registration but the numbers are only known by the application. The pager
      must be logged in to issue a "Page".  
<br><br>
## Production Phases:

The application will be produced in five different phases.
   * Phase I
      - A simple dynamically produced page that connects to a database. Users will not log in and everyone will see the same data. It is in this phase I plan to work out some of the kinks for the basic UI.
      - Basic checklist generation.
   * Phase II
      - User\Supervisor registration and login will be implemented along with better overall design. Navbar for quick site navigation. Fully formed Database entries with image and product description.
   * Phase III
      - Implementation of user generated reports to be emailed to the supervisor. 
   * Phase IV
      - Fully functional messaging system to be used between super and employee.
   * Phase V
      - Integrated QR Scanner to make checklists faster and easier.   

## Future Proposed features:
 - a QR scanner to allow an employees to simply scan a part and generate a checklist. No need to hand select a part.
 - A 2 way texting feature that will work SMS both ways. As it is it will stil keep an employess\supervisors info private.
<br><br><br>

## Realistic thoughts about the project:

Some of these features would become cumbersome to seasoned employees, in fact, they all would. Once an employee knows their route there will be little to no need to use this application, save the the benefits of tracking parts for a particular route or to use as a communication portal without sharing personal information. However the benefits mostly lie with the introduction of new employees so they can do their job more effeciently sooner, and the bells and whisltes are just demonstrative of the skill set I employ.

 # Disclaimer:

 This application is in no way meant to be affiliated with my current employer. It is only being used as a model for a personal portofolio project, and no property (Part numbers or route names) will be used in the production of said software. I am using my experience as a material handler to solve a problem I have encountered in my day to day life, in the hopes of demonstrating my skills as a software developer to future prospected employers.
